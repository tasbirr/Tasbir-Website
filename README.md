# Tasbir Rahaman's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a showcase of my experiences, education, and achievements as a Computer Science student and professional. I created this website to highlight my journey and share my skills with potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the files and directories that make up my website:


### `index.html`
This is the main landing page of my portfolio. It features sections like `Home`, `About Me`, `Experiences`, and `Education`.

### `more.html`
This page dives deeper into my professional experiences. It contains a detailed timeline of the roles Iâ€™ve held, complete with company logos and descriptions of my responsibilities and achievements.

### `styles.css`
All the styling for the site is contained in this file. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and ensures that the website is responsive on different devices.

### `script.js`
This file contains the JavaScript used for animations and other interactive elements on the site.

### `assets/my CV.pdf`
A downloadable PDF of my CV. Feel free to check it out for a more traditional summary of my experience and skills.

### `images/`
This directory holds all the images used on the site, including my avatar and the logos of companies I've worked with.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** My website is fully responsive, meaning it looks great on any device, whether you're on a computer, tablet, or phone.
- **Parallax Sections:** On the `index.html` page, I've implemented parallax scrolling to create a visually engaging experience.
- **Detailed Timeline:** The `more.html` page features a comprehensive timeline of my professional experiences, with logos and descriptions that make it easy to see what I've done.
- **Easy Navigation:** On the `more.html` page, I've included a centered avatar in the navbar. Clicking it will take you back to the previous page, making navigation simple and intuitive.
